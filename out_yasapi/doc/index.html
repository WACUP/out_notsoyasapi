<p><b>
The "Yet Another (WA)SAPI Output Plugin for Winamp" (YASAPI) utilizes
the "Windows Audio Session API" (WASAPI). WASAPI's <i>exclusive
mode</i> for rendering audio is a native way on Windows to render audio
undisturbed, similar to Steinberg's "Audio Stream Input/Output" (ASIO).
The YASAPI output plugin may serve as a replacement for any other
Winamp output plugin.
</b>

<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT IS AN EXPERIMENTAL RATHER THEN AN INDUSTRIAL
STRENGTH EFFORT. THIS PROJECT IS <b>NOT</b> FOR YOU. IT IS FOR ME IN ORDER TO
LEARN SOMETHING. IF THERE IS SOMETHING ALONG THE WAY I CAN DO FOR YOU THAT'S
FINE.

  something into larger building blocks and something into dust. The larger building

<a name="intro"><h3>2. Introduction</h3>

<p>According to Microsoft:

<blockquote cite="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd370784%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">
The Core Audio APIs were introduced in Windows Vista. This is a new set of user-mode audio components provides client applications with improved audio capabilities. These capabilities include the following:
<ul>
<li>Low-latency, glitch-resilient audio streaming.
<li>Improved reliability (many audio functions have moved from kernel mode to user mode).
<li>Improved security (processing of protected audio content takes place in a secure, lower-privilege process).
<li>Assignment of particular system-wide roles (console, multimedia, and communications) to individual audio devices.
<li>Software abstraction of the audio endpoint devices (for example, speakers, headphones, and microphones) that the user manipulates directly.
</ul>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd370784%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd370784%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Of special interest is that there is an <i>exclusive mode</i> for
rendering audio, i.e. there is a mode where an application has 
exclusive access to the audio device without being disturbed by
third parties.

<p>The aim of the YASAPI plugin is to make the WASAPI exclusive mode
for audio rendering available to the users of Winamp.

<p>The name of the plugin was choosen because there are already at
least two WASAPI output plugins for Winamp:

<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://maiko.elementfx.com/">Maiko WASAPI output plugin</a>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://adionsoft.net/winampwasapi/">adionSoft Winamp WASAPI Output Plugin</a>
</ul>

<a name="implement"><h3>3. Implementation</h3>

<p>There are two sides the YASAPI plugin has to take into account:
<ul>
<li>the WASAPI side, and
<li>the Winamp side.
</ul>

<p>The implementation on the WASAPI side follows along the lines of an
<a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd316756%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">example</a>
provided by Microsoft. The startegy shown in this example is not only
applicable for shared mode streams but also for exclusive mode ones,
i.e.  not the <i>share mode</i> should be emphasized but what is known
as the <i>push model</i>. There is also an
<a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd370844%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">example</a>
demonstrating the <i>pull model</i> in conjunction with the
<i>exclusive mode</i>. In that sence there are four strategies:

<ul>
<li>push exclusive,
<li>push shared,
<li>plull exclusive, and
<li>plull shared.
</ul>

<p>The YASAPI plugin implements the first two strategies, i.e. the ones
based on the push model.

<p><a name="push">The push model, in principle, works as follows:

<ol>
<li>Query the size of the buffer shared with the audio device.
<li>Fill in completety the buffer shared with the audio device.
<li>Start playing.
<li>Loop until the track is played:
<ol>
  <li>Sleep half of the time corresponding to the size of the buffer
    shared with the audio device.
  <li>Into the buffer shared with the audio device, fill in the gap which
    was growing free by playing during sleep.
</ol>
<li>Sleep until the possibly remaining filled rest of the buffer shared
  with the audio device was played.
<li>Stop playing.
</ol>
</ol>

<p>But the YASAPI plugin not only has to take into account the
WASAPI side (the loop consisting of sleeping and writing to the
audio device) but also the Winamp side because Winamp provides
the audio samples which should be played in an completely
unpredictable way.

<p>The YASAPI plugin decouples the two sides by means of a
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer">ring or circular buffer</a>.
That way,
<ul>
<li>Winamp can luckily write to the ring buffer whenever it likes
without caring about WASAPI, and
<li>WASAPI can luckily read from the ring buffer and write to the
  audio device wehenever it likes without caring about Winamp.
</ul>

<p>According to step 2 of the push model sketched <a href="#push">above</a>,
it shoud become clear that the ring buffer should be at least as
large (or larger) as the buffer the plugin's WASAPI component shares
with the audio device.

<a name="config"><h3>4. Configuration</h3>

<p>The YASAPI plugin comes with a configuration dialog which is described
in the following. The dialog's top region presents the two
most important parameters "Mode" (exclusive or share) and "Strategy" (push or pull)

<p>Below those two parameters you find a tab-control consisting of four pages,
<ul>
<li>a page for setting general (i.e. non device dependent) parameters,
<li>a page for choosing the device, and
<li>two pages for setting per device parameters.
</ul>

<p>The tab-control's first page looks as follows:

<center><img src="images/config-1.jpg"></center>

<p>It let's you configure

<ul>
<li>whether mono should be treated as stereo (i.e. the one mono channel
  should be duplicated),
<li>whether Winamp's volume control should be enabled, and
<li>whether the
<a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd370881%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">IAudioClock</a>
interface (WASAPI) or the
<a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd370881%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">GetTickCount</a>
function (System) should be used for synchronizing with Winamp.
</ul>

<p>On the next page there are the following per device options:

<center><img src="images/config-2.jpg"></center>

<ul>
<li>the share mode, either exlusive, shared or automatic (automatic
is similar to exclusive, except in case exclusive fails it falls back
to shared), in case shared or automatic mode is choosen
<ul>
  <li>whether the audio should be automatically re-sampled,
  <li>whether a more accurate re-sampling algorithmen should be applied, and finally
</ul>
<li>the strategy, either push or pull.
</ul>

<p>On the final page you can configure the following per device buffer sizes:

<center><img src="images/config-3.jpg"></center>

<ul>
<li>the duration of the buffer shared with the audio device (device period),
<li>the size of the ring buffer which should be a (small) multiple
  of the buffer  the plugin's WASAPI component shares with the audio device, and
<li>the number of samples which should be available in the ring buffer before
  playing starts.
</ul>

<p>From the above <a href="#push">sketch of the push model</a> it shold be clear
that the following relation holds (which is enforced by the configuration dialog):
<blockquote>
minimum size of the buffer shared with the device (provided by WASAPI)
&lt;= size of buffer shared with the device
&lt;= number of samples in the ring buffer before start playing
&lt;= size of ring buffer
</blockquote>
As a rule of thumb all buffer sizes should be <i>1.0</i> except the ring buffer's
size which should be just a small amount greater then <i>1.0.</i>

<p>Please note that no option takes effect before hitting the OK button.

<a name="debug"><h3>5. Debug</h3>

<p>In case something went wrong you may be interested in some more
information. In order to utilize this there is a debug version
of the plugin (distinguished by a lower case "d" at the and of
the name, i.e. <tt>out_yasapi<i>d</i>.dll</tt>) available from the
download site.

<p>Do the following:
<ol>
<li>Close Winamp.
<li>Copy <tt>"out_yasapi-debug.dll"</tt> to Winamp's <tt>"Plugin"</tt> folder.
<li>Start Winamp.
<li>A console window should pop up tracing the initialiazation
  of the debug YASAPI plugin.
<li>From Winamps's preferences dialog choose <tt>"out_yasapi-debug.dll"</tt>
  as output plugin.
<li>When playing tracks in Winamp, the debug YASAPI plugin traces
  initialization and cleanup of each track.
<li>When shutting down Winamp, the cleanup of the YASAPI debug
  plugin is traced.
<li>After closing Winamp, the console window remains visible for
  another 5 s before vanishing.
</ol>

<center>
<p><img src="images/debug.jpg">
<p>The debug console.
</center>

<p>You can get rid of the debug console by choosing the respective
"Console" option from the debug YASAPI plugin's configuration dialog:

<p><center><img src="images/config-debug.jpg"></center>

<p>The following debug options can be configured:
<ul>
<li>whether the debug console is switched <i>Off</i> or on and
  displaying a trace in <i>Default</i> or <i>Verbose</i> mode, and
<li>how long closing the debug console should be delayed from
  closing Winamp.
</ul>

<a name="build"><h3>5. Compiling from Source</h3>
<h4>5.1 Prerequisits</h4>
<p>A big "thank you" goes out
<ul>
<li>to the good engeneers at Microsoft for managing after all these years
  to ship an updated version of their command line <tt>C</tt> compiler
  <tt>cl.exe</tt>, these days buried deep inside the "visual experience"
  (as far as I understand <tt>cl.exe</tt> is not needed by the "visual
  experience" hyped by the marketing staff at M$ anyway), and
<li>to Alexey Pavlov et. al. for providing the great <i>MSys2</i> environment
  supporting to build native Windows applications in an UNIX like style.
</ul>
<p>The following prerequisites are needed in order to build <i>YASAPI</i>
  from the sources:
<ul>
  <li><i>Microsoft Visual C</i>
  <li><i>Microsoft Windows SDK</i>
  <li>You get both, <i>Microsoft Visual C</i>, and <i>Microsoft Windows SDK</i>,
    in one batch by installing 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx">Visual Studio Community 2013</a>
    (That's what I did: Please note that it is best to disable all options
    before installation. That may be not true for <i>Visual Studio Community 2015</i>,
    which seems to install by default all the "visual experience" bload, but not
    the traditional <tt>C</tt> stuff, which you first have to opt for.)
  <li>MSys2: For installation refer to
  <a target="_blank" href="http://msys2.github.io/">http://msys2.github.io/</a>
  and
  <a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/MSYS2%20installation/">https://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/MSYS2%20installation/</a>)
  <li>Inside <i>Msys2</i>:
  <ul>
  <li><tt>wget</tt> (command for installation:
    <tt>pacman -S wget</tt>)
  <li><tt>tar</tt> (command for installation:
    <tt>pacman -S tar</tt>)
  <li><tt>make</tt> (command for installing:
